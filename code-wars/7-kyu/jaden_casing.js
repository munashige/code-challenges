/*Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. 
When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll

Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual 
quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.
